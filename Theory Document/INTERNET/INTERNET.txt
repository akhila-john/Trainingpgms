                       INTERNET

=> it is a wire .two computers connected to the wire can communicate each other.
=> A server is a special computer connected directly to the internet and webpage is the file outside its drive.

=> Every server has a unique IP address.It helps computers find each other.
   Ex : google.com-- 72.14.205.100
        facebook.com -- 69.63.176.140
   for easiness we use domian names as google, facebook etc..rather than their IP address.

=> The computer used by the user is the client (not server)as they are not directly conected to the internet.
=> The client is connected indirectly to the internet through Intenet Service Provider.
   Servers are computers that store webpages, sites etc
   when a client wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the servr onto the client machine to be displayed in the users web browser.

===>>> If we want to visit a yahoo.com, which is both the server and ISP,the user goes through the ISP to internet and looks for yahoo.com.  
       The user computer connects to yahoo.com and can access its webpages.
       Suppose the user wants to send mailto the usr1,
       the user logins to the mail account and compose the messgaeto user1 mailid andthe message is sendto the user1mail.
       when the user1 dials into her accout,gets the message.
=> When an email or image travels accross the internet, the computer breaks the information into smmaler pieces called packets.
   when the packets reaches the destination, they are reassembled to original order.

=> Everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet will have an IP address.
=> Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersects, there is a ROUTER.
   Router directs the packet so that they are one step closer to the destination.


                        HOW INTERNET WORKS

=> Data is accessed from the data centre to our device using optical fiber cable.                              [datacenter-->server-->ssd]
=> everything is stored in the ssd within the datacenter.the ssd acts as the internal memory of the server.
   Server is the powerful computer that provides the stored content when requested.
=> everythn connected to the internet whether a computer or server or mobile is identified using an IP address.
   IP adress acts as the address through which all the information reaches the destination. The ISP of our system decides the IP address.
=> The server in the datacenter also have an IP address.The server stores the website and through the IP address or domain name can access the website.

=> To access the internet we mainly uses the domian names.
   The internet gets the IP address corresponding to the domain name from the DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM [DNS].
   The ISP can manage the DNS.

=> When we enters the domain name (facebook.com),the browser sends a request to the DNS server to get the corresponding IP address.
=> After getting the IP address, the browser forwards the request to the datacenter i.e to the respective server.
   Once the server gets request to accesss to the specific website, the data flow starts.
   The data flows in digital format via optical fibercables (as light pulses) . These light pulses travels via fiber cables through miles,underwater, terrains etc
   and finally reaches to the router of the destination (home routers).
   The routers converts these light signals to electrical signals which is passed to the laptops etc..
    If using cellular data(mobile), the signal from fiber cable goes to the cell tower from where the signal reaches the cellphones in the form of electromagnetic waves.
=> The datas are transmitted as 0s AND 1s in the form of packets by the server
   Ech of the packet contains IP address and sequence numbers.
   These packets takes best available router routes and when the packets reaches the destination (mobile), they are reassembled to original order.


** These ip address assignment , domain name registration etc is all managed by the institution called ICANN[Interet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers] in USA.

           HOW WEBSERVER WORKS

=> The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on .
=> The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client .
   This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
=> If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message,  and then starts sending the website's files
   to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets .
=> The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you.


           WEBPAGE
=> A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge, or Apple's Safari. 
   These are also often called just "pages."

           WEBSITE
=> A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "web site" or a "site."
          
      WEBSERVER
=> A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. 
  "Hosting" means that all the web pages and their supporting files are available on that computer. 
   The web server will send any web page from the website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request.

   SEARCH ENGINE
=> Search engines are a common source of confusion on the web. A search engine is a special kind of website that helps users find web pages from other websites.
   eX: google, etc..

   BROWSERS
=> the first time someone launches a browser, the browser displays a search engine's homepage. 
   EX : mozilla, googlechrome etc..

           DOMAIN NAMES

=>     developer.mozilla.org
          |         |      |
         label2   label1  TLD

 * TLDs:-  tell users the general purpose of the service behind the domain name. The most generic TLDs (.com, .org, .net).
           Local TLDs such as .us, .fr, or .se can require the service to be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country
           TLDs containing .gov are only allowed to be used by government departments.
           The .edu TLD is only for use by educational and academic institutions.
 * label:-  A label is a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to sixty-three characters in length, containing only the 
           letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9.
           A domain name can have many labels.

   How it Works
=> Type mozilla.org in your browser's location bar.
   Your browser asks your computer if it already recognizes the IP address identified by this domain name (using a local DNS cache). If it does, the name is translated to the IP address and the browser negotiates contents with the web server. End of story.
   If your computer does not know which IP is behind the mozilla.org name, it goes on to ask a DNS server, whose job is precisely to tell your computer which IP address matches each registered domain name.
   Now that the computer knows the requested IP address, your browser can negotiate contents with the web server.
