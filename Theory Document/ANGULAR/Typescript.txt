* Open-source programming language from microsoft.
* Typed superset of javascript.(contains additional in typescript)
* compiles down to plain javscript.

* it is the extended javascript. (.js to .ts can be extended)
*  catch the errors : adds type support to javascript as a result errors are  identified as typing the code and during compile time also.
* IDE support 
* intellisence support

* to install typescript =>npm install -g typescript
* compile => tsc <name>
* run => node <name>


** When we compile the typescript file, it creates  .js file which contains the transpiled
   code.

** whenever an application is build,the typescript compiler transpiles to javascript so that the browser can undrstand.

* Conerting typescript to javascript is called TRANSPILING.

* cannot change the type in typescript . ex: let count= 5;
                                             count = 'a'; // it shows error as count type is number
* Typescript compiler reports error but still generates valid javascript code.
  It can be given as : let a;  //here type is any
                      a= 5;
                      a= true;
                      a = 'sam';

* arrow functions:
    > let log = function(message) {                       // in javascript function
          console.log(message);
       }

    > let log = (mesage) => console.log(message)   // arrow function in typescript

* diferent types  are :
 > let a : number;
 > let a : boolean;
 > let a : string;
 > let a : any;
 > let a : number[] = [1, 2, 3];
