SERVICE

* singleton 
* services interact with API.
* fetching data from some other server.
* injected into aplication using dependency injection mechanism.
* need to create and inject services in components where we want to use them.

* @injectbale decorator informs angular that we can inject into components.


* create service using ng g s <name>.
* to interact with Http url, shld create HTTP client.So import httpclientmodle and also add to import array so that it is accesicble in appmodule.
* service creted is given in the providers.
* declare httpclient as dependency in constructor . alsoimport httpclient to service class.
*  provides get method where get takes in url.
* cast the response to an array : get returns observable.[HTTP module uses observables to handle requests and responses].
                                  so it must be converted to atype usab;e in the aplication
         > create an interface and the add the variables so that it creates a type where the observable can cast to.
         > give observable type in get method in the service class and also import in the service class.
* Data gets provided only when subscribe is given.
  > first argument in the subscribe is the data received from the observable to the local property.


* The service makes request to the database with the http methods (get).
* As a response will get back the observables.
     

* We sends http request and gets http response to from the SERVER.
*The server at the end serves as the API (rest api).
* That code (rest api) interacts with thw databse => angular.
* Depends on the url (api) interacting with.

    HTTP Request structure
**  Http Verb           => POST, GET,PUT etc..
**  URL (API Endpoint)  => /posts/1
**  Headers(Metadata)   => { "contents-type":"application/json"}
**  Body                => { title:" new post"}
